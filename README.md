# OrganVital---Website
OrganVital - Organ and Blood Donation Awareness Website Project Overview This project is a dynamic and interactive website designed to raise awareness about organ and blood donation. The website features a clean, modern design with both light and dark mode options, a responsive navigation bar, image animations, and interactive FAQ sections. It focuses on delivering key messages about the importance of organ donation through engaging visuals and smooth user interactions.

Key Features Dark and Light Mode Toggle:

Users can switch between dark and light modes using a toggle button. The selected mode persists across page refreshes using localStorage. Animated Quote Section:

A dynamic quote section that displays motivational messages about organ donation. Corresponding images of organs (kidney, heart, and liver) change with each quote. Animation pauses when the user hovers over the quote or image and resumes when the hover ends. Responsive Navigation Bar:

A fully responsive navigation bar with a sidebar menu for smaller screens. The sidebar can be opened and closed via toggle buttons. Clicking outside the sidebar closes it automatically. Search Functionality:

A search button that toggles a search input field. Smooth transitions for the search field with clear visibility in both light and dark modes. Interactive FAQ Section:

Expandable and collapsible FAQ items using an accordion feature. Smooth animations and visual cues when sections are expanded or collapsed. Login and Registration Toggle:

A contact form with toggles for switching between login and registration views. Smooth transitions between login and registration sections. Responsive Design:

The layout adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes. Components are styled to ensure a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. Footer Section:

A comprehensive footer with contact information, links, and social media icons. Stylish design with a gradient background and clear organization of content. Technologies Used HTML for structure and content. CSS for styling, including light/dark mode themes, animations, and responsiveness. JavaScript for interactivity, such as: Dark mode toggle with localStorage support. Animated quotes and image transitions. Sidebar menu control. Interactive FAQ accordion. Login and registration toggle functionality. How It Works Dark Mode:

Clicking the dark mode toggle button switches between dark and light themes and saves the preference in localStorage. Animated Quotes:

The quotes and corresponding images change every 800 milliseconds. Hovering over the text or image pauses the animation. Sidebar Navigation:

The sidebar opens when the user clicks the menu icon and closes when the user clicks the close button or outside the sidebar area. FAQ Accordion:

Clicking on a question expands or collapses the answer panel, providing a better user experience for viewing information. Project Goals Awareness: Educate users on the importance of organ and blood donation. Engagement: Keep users engaged with interactive elements and animations. User-Friendly Design: Provide a seamless experience with responsive design, easy navigation, and accessibility features.
